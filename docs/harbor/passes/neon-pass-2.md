## NEON PASS 2 (Oct 21 2026) — the building neon fixed, the midsection lit, the waterfront, the drones' colours, real neon sound
From the owner's zoomed iPhone review. Everything behind `?city=2`.

### 1. The building neon, fixed
- **Occlusion + clean ends** (`neon.js#cutOutlines`): every line is cut at ITS OWN depth against the envelope of nearer buildings
  (each line carries its `z`), and a tower's contour against that envelope *dilated* by ~5 pt (`R`) — the sun corridors (`SUN_GAPS`,
  narrow gaps in the near band) no longer let a tube drop down a gap to a lower roof. Every run ends at an electrode CAP (`tubes.js#caps`,
  the last 4 points dimmed: `capLight`); runs shorter than 5 pt are dropped (`dropStubs`). Nothing within 2.5 pt of the screen's edge.
- **No stair-steps** (`core/harbor-neon.js`): a tower's contour starts at its FOOT, tiers closer than `MIN_STEP` (1.1) merge, the crown is
  ONE step (deco / stepped / mast), and every corner is FILLETED (`fillet(pts, FILLET = 0.8)`: a quadratic bend, 6 samples).
- **Signs vs tubes:** a sign's, an icon's or a billboard's cabinet (+1.4 pt) and the wheel's disc cut the tubes (`blockersOf`). **Signs are
  solid:** the cabinets are cut out of each outline sprite's LIGHT when it is baked (destination-out) — no glow shows through a sign;
  the live chasers + the flash sweep draw through an even-odd clip only while they run (`solidClip`). Tier 0's composite the same.
- **No sign on a hero tower:** `n-empire` is gone; `i-par2` (an icon on the PAR quay block) added — **5 named + 7 icons**, every game a
  sign each night; all inside [3, W − 3] at 390 / 402 / 412 / 430 (tested). The construction tower (`wordV`) stays free of signs.
- **The billboard:** its paper seams sit UNDER the paint; the small second line shows only where it is ≥ 6.5 pt (never on a phone).
- **The wheel's quiet zone:** no tube behind its disc; ~~a soft night-air VEIL inside the rim~~ (removed in NEON PASS 3: the wheel is
  see-through).
- **The sun + moon arch** (`scene.js#archFor`): the apex just under the NEON word (`cam.word`), passing behind the tagline; the winter
  path + the real timing unchanged. The tagline gets a soft dark text-shadow (`.nd-tag-shade`, no box) while the sun's or the moon's
  disc is within 1.6 r of it (`title.js#tagShade`). Checked: the summer noon sun + the Dec 24 full moon at 390 / 402 / 430.

### 2. The midsection, lit (`core/harbor-neon.js` — the bands)
- The NEAR band (share 0.86): WARM roles across the screen (pink / amber / red: `h0 a0 h1 a1`) — every building a roofline; then by its
  dice a thin Deco LEDGE band (< 0.36), CORNER TRIMS (< 0.6), FINS (< 0.76). The MID band (0.4) cooler (`b1 b0 h1`), the far 0.1.
  Buildings whose face reaches the wheel's disc get none. The quay heroes: a roofline + a ledge at 30 % + trims (PAR pink, JAZZ amber).
  The palette rules hold (tested: the warm near band; the rest base > heat > accent).

### 3. THE WATERFRONT STRIP (`screens/harbor/waterfront.js`, new)
The far shore's ground floor as a RIBBON OF WARM STOREFRONT GLOW along the water — read on a phone by COLOUR + SHAPE + REFLECTION
(the owner's add-on: it is a few pt tall there):
- **storefronts** only where they can be seen at street level (`storefronts(L)`: the near band + the heroes, nearer ones hiding the
  ones behind), never behind the wheel, never cut by the screen's edge; every neighbour different; ONE theatre (the widest front in
  the middle). 10 on a 390 phone, 39 on a 1440 desktop.
- **each shop:** a striped AWNING (scalloped), a shop WINDOW (sky in the glass by day; its own warm light at night — amber, rose, warm
  white, a teal diner — with a figure or two), and above it a simple NEON SHAPE: cocktail glass, coffee cup, arrow, fish, music note,
  pizza slice, star, heart (unlit glass by day). **Names** (BAR, DINER, OYSTERS…) only on a wide screen and only where the letters are
  ≥ 3.6 pt — a long name on a narrow front takes its shape (`debug().named`).
- **the THEATRE:** a marquee of CHASING BULBS round its canopy (drawn live: the strip's one moving part).
- **the water:** LONG WOBBLY REFLECTIONS — each lit shop queues a long light column (`water.light(x, y, col, a, w, len)`: the new `len`)
  the mirror's ripples break up; the strip itself is mirrored (drawn before the water). Baked: one art sprite per look + one lit sprite
  (0.4 MB at 390). `&force=no-waterfront`.

### 4. THE DRONES' COLOURS (`core/harbor-sky.js#droneShape`, `drones.js`, `skyfx.js`)
- A message: one colour (`col: [r,g,b]` / `'rainbow'` across the letters) or a colour per word / per letter (`cols` + `by: 'word' |
  'letter'`); shapes keep their own colours. Any drone any colour (`hsv()`).
- THE COLOUR WAVE: through each morph a drone takes its new colour when a wave sweeping left → right reaches it (its place across the
  box: `xns`) — the change ripples across the swarm (calm shows: all at once). `cycle`: while a formation holds, its colours drift
  slowly round the hues (24 cached glows).
- The API: `harbor().sky.drones(specs, { colour, colours, by, cycle, wave })` (hex or [r,g,b]; a spec's own `col` / `cols` win). The
  preview: `&force=drones&text=HI%20THERE&colours=ff2e97,2ee6ff&by=word` (`&colour=rainbow`, `&cycle=1`). `debug().colours` counts them.
- The holding-formation-as-one-image fallback is NOT built: the show's cost on the owner's iPhone isn't known yet (Known issues).

### 5. REAL NEON SOUND (`audio/sfx/neon-*.wav`, `audio/ambience.js`, `title.js` — City 2.0 only) → `docs/audio.md`
Four CC0 Freesound recordings cut + levelled by `scripts/build-neon-sfx.py`: four flickers (random, never the same twice running) on
the warm-up's strikes and the dawn's stutters, the dropout when a tube cuts out, the power-on at THE CATCH, the hum looping very
quietly while the sign is lit. The synthesized sounds stay as the fallback.

### 6. The iPhone's slow frames (tier 2, a party night: 3.0 / 4.0 ms of work but 6 % slow frames)
**Where the frames go:** not the CPU — the GPU's FILL at DPR 2. Counting every pixel the main canvas blends a frame (a `drawImage`
probe, 402 × 874 at DPR 2), a party night painted **6.7 full screens** of pixels a frame: the vignette 1.0, the sky 0.67 + the star
field 0.67, each city band twice (its baked layer + its lit windows: far 0.70, near 0.73, the stage 0.41), the logo's haze 0.46, the
lamps 0.35, the rest small (the neon sprites are ~0.4 in all). The party itself is DOM / CSS (not in that count).
**Reduced, same picture** (Porter-Duff "over" is associative — checked pixel for pixel: only moving things differ):
- a band + its lit windows drawn as ONE bitmap while both are steady (`scene.js#pair`, rebuilt when either re-bakes or the light level
  moves a 64th; any fade / the power-on wave draws them apart); the star field folded into the sky bitmap (`stars.base()` + `skyMix`).
  **6.7 → 5.3 screens a frame (−21 %)**, +4 MB of canvas (35 of 64). `&force=no-merge` draws them apart (the A-B check).
- What's left: the vignette (a full-screen blend; only its centre is clear) and the logo's haze — both change the look to cut.
  Whether the 6 % goes: the owner's iPhone (`&when=2026-10-24T23:00&debug=1`).

### Performance (A-B-B-A against 50bc995, 4× CPU, the laptop without a GPU, 402 × 874; ms of scene work a frame)
| scene | tier 2 (≤ 8) | tier 1 (≤ 6) | tier 0 (≤ 4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `np-party` | 8.07 → **8.44** | 6.35 → **6.38** | 3.99 → **4.26** |
| `np-night` | 6.74 → 7.12 | 5.76 → **6.02** | 3.86 → **4.11** |

The first round read +0.5–0.7 ms; the fix (the solid-sign clip baked into the sprites instead of clipped every frame) halved it.
The rest is the new neon (the midsection's lines, the waterfront's lights + the marquee). Frames p50 16.7 ms everywhere. One fix,
one re-measure, reported (the party peak at tier 2 was already over before this pass).

### Known issues (NEON PASS 2)
- **Over the bench's budget by ~0.3 ms** (the table): the party peak at tier 2 (8.44, already 8.07 before) and tier 0 (4.26), a night
  at tier 0 (4.11) + tier 1 (6.02). The next step if the owner's iPhone shows it: the waterfront's lit sprite + the marquee into the
  near group's composite at tier 0.
- **The drone show over budget at tiers 1 + 0** (Part 6a) still stands — the hold-as-one-image fallback waits for the owner's iPhone.
- On a phone the WATERFRONT is partly hidden (the near corner building on the left, the paddle steamer in the middle), so its long
  reflections show mostly in the open water right of the steamer.
- The party chasers still draw through a per-frame clip (only while they run).
- `e2e-harbor`'s PERF check (party peak, 4× CPU) sits at the edge of tier 2's budget: 8.66 / 6.77 ms over three runs (failed once,
  passed last; the table's first row). Two of its checks are flaky (each passed in other runs this pass; the last run 60 / 61): BATTERY (a light re-bake landing in its 3-second calm window) and RE-LAYOUT (its pixel on the
  speakeasy's wall by the door: a passer-by).
- The recorded neon sounds were cut + levelled by script from the raw downloads (the brief expected trimmed files) — **check them by
  ear**; `NEON_GAIN` (ambience.js) trims all of them at once; re-cut with `python -I scripts/build-neon-sfx.py` (times in the script).
- Not checked in WebKit (no WebKit here).

### Handoff → Part 6b (the special-occasion sky)
As Part 6a's handoff above. New since: the drones' colours (`colour / colours / by / cycle / wave`) for CITY CONTROL's picker; the
waterfront's shops (`SHOPS`) are where Part 8's people can walk in; `water.light(…, len)` for anything that wants a long streak.
