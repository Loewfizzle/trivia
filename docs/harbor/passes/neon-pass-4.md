## NEON PASS 4 — THE NEON IN MOTION (Oct 22 2026): party nights a real show, every night stunning
The owner watched Neon Pass 3's party night on her iPhone and could not tell it was a party night. Her words: "In party mode the
neon needs to be racing around the tubes — motion, flashes, shimmer. It has to look impressive." Now a still of 11 pm Saturday
next to 11 pm Wednesday is clearly different at phone size, and the party moves (frame bursts, 402×874, the share of skyline
pixels changing > 24 between frames 250 ms apart: 402 — a normal night 5.4 %, the party at 9 pm 6.8 %, 11 pm 10.1 %, 1 am 8.1 %;
430 — 3.5 / 4.5 / 9.3 / 6.9 %).

### 1. THE PARTY (core/harbor-show.js — PURE + tested; drawn by neon.js)
- **THE PARTY SCHEME (every tier):** on a party night the outlines are re-lit in `SCHEMES.party` (magenta, hot pink, gold,
  electric blue, violet, lime — core/harbor-neon.js), rebuilt a few a frame LEFT → RIGHT (the colour rolls across the skyline as
  the party starts; hysteresis on 0.3 / off 0.15 of the party's strength). An explicit scheme (a holiday, a preview) wins
  (`neon.moment('scheme', name)` → `schemeX`). The city's glow over the skyline turns a warmer pink-violet (sky.js `o.party`,
  repainted when the party starts / ends — baked with the sky).
- **THE HARD BEAT** (`punchEnv(u, T)`, `beatOf(phase, rate, bpm)`): every beat PUNCHES — a ~50 ms attack (smoothstep; ≥ 40 ms,
  tested) to a clearly brighter peak, a ~140 ms decay; the downbeat (the first beat of a breath) ×1, the others ×0.72, a drop ×1.6.
  Between beats the tubes sit at ~0.8; on a downbeat at the peak they reach ~1.8 — the part over 1 is the sprite drawn again,
  additive (core + glow swell together). It ripples across the screen in the `ripple` scenes. Never dark (≥ 0.6, tested), never
  a hard on/off, no full-screen flash. No song playing: a party's 120 bpm inside the clock's slow breath. `PT.punch` (scene.js) is
  the city's punch for everything else that pulses: the signs + icons, the blade's bulbs, the wheel, the pier lamps, the string
  lights, the sky beams, and the title's rings + SPEAKEASY (title.js#partyFrame: opacity only — SPEAKEASY's new `.nd-word-p`
  glow layer, the rings' glow layer; the big bloom keeps its gentle level: re-compositing it every frame cost a slow phone 60 ms).
- **RACING LIGHT** (`out.race`, `neon.js#race`): pulses racing round the WHOLE outline of every hero + word tower, most mid
  buildings, half the bands, some of the quay — a dash pattern moving along pre-built paths (one Path2D per colour role a building):
  a soft coloured glow (tier 2), the coloured tail, a white-hot HEAD at the leading end; a pulse every ~38 pt; per-building speed
  (70–160 pt/s) + direction (`out.sp`, `out.dir`), a third reversing every two bars; the speed SURGES on the beat. The offset is
  integrated per building (a reversal never jumps). The lighthouse doesn't race (its own beam).
- **FLASHES:** the crowns + spires flare on the strong beats (every crown on a drop); a few towers STROBE colour-to-colour on the
  beat in `race+strobe` (a 60 ms crossfade; < 40 % of the city, tested).
- **SHIMMER** (`shimmerFx`): a band of glints rolls across the skyline every ~5 s, sparkling along the tubes it passes and lighting
  the crowns white-hot. The water mirrors all of it (its reflections dance with the colour for free).
- **SCENES:** WARM (glow, sweep-slow, climb-slow, chase-heroes), PEAK (ripple+climb, sweep+fins, call+chase, climb+crowns,
  sweep-back+chase, call+fins, **race+strobe** — new), AFTER — layered over the racing light; ~a quarter of the city holds steady
  in any scene; a scene runs 20–40 s at the song's rate (`SECS`; `f.rate`).
- **THE NIGHT** (`harborParty(h)` — the harbor's own curve; core/party.js's window, City 1.0's energy unchanged): 9 pm warm-up
  (energy 0.6, already clearly a party) → the 11 pm peak (1) → calming after 1 am (0.7) → the 2 am wind-down (core/party.js).
- **THE SKY BEAMS** (`screens/harbor/skybeams.js`, the owner's Luxor idea): on party nights the tall towers each shoot a
  stationary vertical beam from the crown, in that tower's colour (its sweep / strobe colour while one holds it — `neon.beamCols`):
  one cached white-hot-core beam sprite per colour (additive), a flare at the root; pulsing on the beat; brighter on a hazy night;
  switching on one by one from 9 pm, all from the peak; **taking turns with the searchlights** at the peak (the searchlights the last
  quarter of every 32 bars, the beams dimmed to 35 % meanwhile — `out.lights` / `out.beams`). The owner's rule: never across the
  NEON word or the tagline — a beam under the sign's width fades out by the tagline's bottom; a tower outside it rises to the top
  of the screen (clear of the corner buttons). Feasibility (measured): on a phone the towers under the sign have ~40–160 pt of sky,
  so a phone shows **2–3 beams** (the right word tower rises to the top; the left edge's tower on the widest phones); desktop 4–5
  (the side towers rise free). **Reusable:** `harbor().skyBeams.set({ count, colours, ids, width })` — July 4th's red / white / blue,
  the Sept 11 Tribute in Light (two white beams) later.
- **THE WHEEL** wears its party colours all party night (NEON PASS 3: the peak only); **Rosie** her party bulbs; the **pier lamps**
  punch; the **game blade's bulbs** run a marquee — a step every beat, one in three lit, punching.
- **Tiers:** tier 2 everything; tier 1 ≤ 5 effects + ≤ 6 racing at once (`MAX_RACE`), no glow pass on the racers, no shimmer;
  tier 0 (the calm city): no live effects — the whole neon (one image, the party scheme) punches on the beat (0.85 → ~1.3), the sky
  beams + the string lights + the wheel still. Reduced motion: a still party (the party scheme, still beams, warm-then-party colours).

### 2. EVERY NIGHT STUNNING (a normal night: calm but alive)
`everyday()`: one sign spells on, **one or two** blink, an icon cycles its colour, **three or four slow chasers** spread across the
skyline (the racing light's renderer, slow: one soft pulse every ~90 pt; tier 1 the first two), colours rotating + changing scheme
through the night, the odd flicker, and **a crown shimmer** every ~20 s (a white highlight running across one crown).

### 2b. STRING LIGHTS on the speakeasy's roof (`screens/harbor/strings.js`)
Round bulbs on gently sagging wires along THE SPEAKEASY's parapet (swags between its posts), a long swag up to the rooftop pole and
back, two loops draped down at the corner; warm white from dusk with a warm glow on the roof edge + the wall below; by day the
unlit glass. PARTY NIGHTS: amber, pink, red, gold, a little violet — cycling slowly at the warm-up, chasing on the beat at the peak
(every third bulb leading, punching); warm white again after the 2 am wind-down. **Reusable:** `createStrings()` +
`set({ scheme: 'warm'|'party'|'christmas'|'halloween' })` / `set({ colours })` — Part 8's promenade strings, Part 11's C9s.
`harbor().strings`; `&force=strings-party` previews the party mode.

### 2c. THE WHEEL reads clean without a veil
- **Quiet office blocks behind it** (`blocks.js#behindWheel`: further than the wheel, its middle inside the disc, its top above
  the hub): mostly dark at night — ~16 % of their windows lit, warm only (no coloured rooms, no party windows) — and a touch
  further back in the haze (their faces mixed into the haze as if 150 units further: lower contrast, never blurred).
- **A stronger wheel:** seven bulbs along each spoke (the spokes read as lines of light) + a brighter strut line, a bolder rim, a
  glowing hub medallion; on a party night the spoke bulbs CHASE OUTWARD from the hub on every beat, the rim sets step round on the
  beat, the whole wheel punching.

### Previews (THE PREVIEW PANEL lists them)
`&force=beams` (the sky beams on any night), `&force=strings-party`, `&scene=race%2Bstrobe`, PARTY ON / OFF; perf A/B switches
`&force=no-race,no-shimmer,no-punch,no-beams,no-strings`.

### The hooks for Part 10 (the fireworks + the midnight finale)
`PT.punch / PT.beatU / PT.beatT / PT.beatIdx / PT.beats` (the hard beat to sync a shell to — `__district.party()` shows them),
`PT.drop / PT.big` (the drops), `neon.show()` (`punch`, `beams`, `racing`, `shimmer`, …), `skyBeams.set` (a finale's colours),
`strings.set`, the wheel's `scheme`, `startFinale()` still the midnight's 4–6 shells; `f.finale` holds the show back to 40 %.

### 3. The fixes carried over
- **No sign clipped** (at 390–430 + desktop, every night — `harbor.test` "no sign is ever clipped", 6 sizes × 120 nights): the
  horizontal names ran ~8 % past their text box (`signs.js#lettersRow` sized letters by /0.86 instead of fitting their ink) — the
  last letter sat on the border tube, its glow reaching the screen edge. Now fitted inside the box. **The trade-off: horizontal sign
  letters are ~12–17 % smaller** (at 402: a 5-letter roof sign 9.0 pt, 6 letters 7.5 pt; were 10.5 / 8.8 while overflowing).
  A name at the screen's edge never SPELLS ON any more (its dark letters read as a sign cut off: `everyday` → `edge`); it may blink.
- **The game blade reads whole** ("THE GAME BLADE reads whole"): docked Rosie's stacks + bulb strings stood over its last letter
  (she now turns on arrival and rests bow-out, `core/harbor-boats.js`), the tug's stop moved 1 unit, the blade + n-par re-fitted
  (n-par's letters ~6.35 → 5.7 pt; the blade's six letters stay 10.15 pt); and the baked lit windows drew over the solid signs'
  cabinets — `signs.js#cabinetCut` now cuts every solid cabinet out of both lit layers (and their per-frame touches).
- **No seams in the water** (Part 4's Known issues has the detail): the ripple strips + the water's blit on whole device rows,
  each strip's crest / trough averaged over the phase it spans; an E2E check at tiers 2 + 1.
- **Searchlights behind signs** ("SEARCHLIGHTS BEHIND SIGNS", "… never sweep across a sign"): each light is clipped to the open air
  above everything nearer than it (buildings + sign cabinets; `searchlights.js#occludersAt / envelope / beamCover`), its flare only
  when its lens is in view; the EMPIRE's lamp on its lowest clear setback, word tower B's behind its roof sign, the hotel's sweep
  narrowed. The sky beams rise from ABOVE a roof sign on their tower (`neon.signRects()`), never through it.
- **The JAZZ sign removed:** the old club is plain city with band trims; its icon spot is now `i-mid` (x 97–117 × y 496–516 at 402,
  the only wall that passes every spot rule) — still 5 named + 7 icons, every game a sign every night.
- **The neon sounds** → `docs/audio.md` (flickers ~12 dB quieter, a 6 ms attack, a 4.5 kHz low-pass, a peak cap music on or off;
  power-on + dropout −6 dB; the warm-up's last 30 s audible, building to the catch).
- RUMRUNNER's lobby art: "CLUB VALE" → "CLUB 21".

### Performance (A-B-B-A against b57e6a7, 4× CPU, the laptop without a GPU, 402 × 874; ms of scene work a frame)
| scene | tier 2 (≤ 8) | tier 1 (≤ 6) | tier 0 (≤ 4) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `np-party` (Sat 23:00, the peak) | 8.07 → **8.57** | 6.40 → **8.79** | 4.60 → **4.86** |
| `np-night` | 7.63 → **8.02** | 6.53 → **7.11** | 4.14 → **4.72** |

While building, one piece at a time off (`n4-*` scenes in title-perf.mjs): the shimmer cost the most (~2.8 ms at tier 2 → its glints
capped, 28 a building, 80 a frame: ~1.3 ms); the racing light, the punch's second draw, the beams and the strings were each ≤ 0.4 ms.
**ONE FIX** after the round: the shimmer on tier 2 only, ≤ 6 racers at tier 1 — re-measured: party t2 8.2 → **8.24**, t1 7.01 →
**8.05**, t0 4.41 → **4.66**; frames held 16.7 ms (p50) everywhere. The E2E's party peak: 8.41 / 7.57 / 4.93 (its PERF check fails by
0.41 ms at tier 2 — reported, not chased: **the owner's iPhone decides**, `&debug=1` read after 10–15 s; it ran Neon Pass 3's party at
3.2–3.3 ms). Memory: the beam sprites (64 × 256 per colour, ≤ 24) + the strings' dots are small; the party scheme re-builds the
outline sprites once at the start + the end of a party (the same size as the city's).

### Known issues (NEON PASS 4)
- **The laptop bench is over its budgets on a party night** (above) — the iPhone's numbers decide; if her tier 2 shows slow frames
  on a party night, the next steps: the racers' glow pass off on tier 2 too, or racing on the hero + word towers only.
- **Phones show 2–3 sky beams** (the towers under the sign have ~40–160 pt of sky before the tagline, the owner's rule); 4–5 on the
  widest phones / desktop.
- **The steamer + the pier** wear party colours and punch on the beat, but don't run a moving marquee: Rosie's bulbs are baked into
  her sprite (a live chase = per-bulb drawing, Part 10 if wanted).
- **The lobby's backdrop** doesn't punch yet: City 2.0 has no `partyLight()` (Part 11), so the menus' still has no party layer.
- **The beat without music** is a party's 120 bpm on the clock (no song to lock to) — with the music playing it follows the song.
- **Sign letters are smaller** (the clipping fix, above) — check the glance test on her iPhone; the alternative is wider cabinets.
- The racing light's dash offset is per phone (two phones side by side race differently; the scenes, beams and beat are the same
  clock as before — the local beat clock).
- Not checked in WebKit (no WebKit here) — the owner's iPhone: the preview links below + `&debug=1`.

### Handoff → THE DAY PASS
The night is done for now: the party show's hooks (above) are Part 10's; the sky beams + the string lights are reusable for the
holidays (Part 11: `skyBeams.set`, `strings.set`). The Day Pass rebuilds the day; nothing here draws by day except the strings' unlit
glass and the wheel's steel (unchanged). Preview links (`?city=2&tz=America/Detroit&at=42.96,-85.67&debug=1&when=…`): a normal night
`2026-10-22T22:00`, the party `2026-10-24T21:00` / `T23:00` / `2026-10-25T01:00`, the boot-up `2026-10-19T18:20&speed=20`.
