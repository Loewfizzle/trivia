# NEON PASS 5 — SAFARI, THE REAL BEAT + THE PARTY POLISHED (Oct 22 2026; night + party nights only)

## NEON PASS 5 — SAFARI, THE REAL BEAT + THE PARTY POLISHED (Oct 22 2026; night + party nights only)
The owner checked Neon Pass 4 on her iPhone: "the pulsing looks pretty good", but her phone showed LESS than the Chromium screenshots
(one sky beam, nothing racing, the panel's SKY BEAMS button doing nothing), the beat felt off, the racing was far too fast and the
party was pink all night. Everything behind `?city=2`.

### 0. Faster harbor tests (nothing dropped)
`e2e-harbor.mjs` is GROUPS now: `core, flags, skyline, neon, water, harbor, sky, party, panel, dock, perf` — `ONLY=party,panel`
runs those in one process (a group may be several chunks, run in the file's order). With no `ONLY` the independent groups run in
**3 parallel shards** (`SHARDS=1|2|3`: child processes, each its own browser — the same checks), then the two that must run alone:
`panel` (it writes the shared `city2/live` node every `?city=2` page listens to) and `perf` (CPU-throttled timing). The fixed sleeps
became waits for the real condition (a re-layout settled, the neon lit, the word + the searchlights, the drones' formation — the drone
show runs on the clock, so `&speed=4` / `&speed=8` fly the same timeline faster —, the water's columns, the title ↔ setup cycles);
the timed windows (a frame-rate measurement, the beat sampled over 3 s) stay. **The whole suite: 223 s → ~190–200 s** on a far busier laptop (99 checks; it was 87): the
parallel part ~70 s for what ran ~130 s in a row, the panel ~50 s (five new checks), perf ~80–100 s (CPU-throttled: it can't share). While working: `ONLY=<the groups the task touches>`; the full suite once before the commit.

### 0a. What was wrong on her iPhone (Safari) — found + fixed
WebKit could not be installed here (Playwright's `webkit-2083` downloads, then its extraction fails — twice; the owner: stop and fix
what's known about Safari). So the cause was found from the code and reproduced in Chromium:
1. **THE TIER (the main one — "everything pulsing, nothing racing")**: the tier step-down watched only the frame INTERVAL. iOS Low
   Power Mode (and Safari in some states) runs `requestAnimationFrame` at 30 Hz however light the page is, so her frames read ~33 ms
   (> 19.5) and the city stepped 2 → 1 → 0 within ~10 s. Tier 0 drops the racing light, the effects and the glow — but keeps the punch:
   exactly what she saw. **Now a step down is a PROBE** (`scene.js#perf`): ~4 s later, if the median interval didn't get faster
   (≥ 85 % of before), it was the phone's cap — the city steps back up and stops stepping down for frame timing (`capped`); only a
   real overload of its own work (mean > 12 ms a frame) still steps it down. The readout says `capped 30 Hz`. E2E: `requestAnimationFrame`
   throttled to a 30 Hz vsync in the page → `2→1→2`, capped 30 Hz.
2. **ONE SKY BEAM**: Neon Pass 4 stopped a beam under the sign's width at the tagline, and dropped a tower with < 40 pt of sky there —
   on her phone that left the right edge's tower. **The whole-sky rule** (plan.md): every hero + word tower's beam rises BEHIND the
   NEON sign and the tagline to the top of the screen (the sign is the page above the canvas: it always draws on top), clear of the
   corner buttons only. The panel's SKY BEAMS button "did nothing" for the same reason (it couldn't add towers the layout had dropped).
   A desktop's dozen beams were capped at 9 at the peak (only the left half lit) — now all.
3. **A LEFTOVER JUST ME STATE** (kept for the tab in sessionStorage) replaced a preview link's own `&when` / `&force`: opening a link
   with its own preview flags (`&when, &force, &speed, &wx, &scene…`; not the tools `&debug` / `&grid`) now drops a stored JUST ME state
   — a refresh of the same page keeps it, as before (`performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0].type`). While JUST ME is on, the
   pill says so — `JUST ME · AURORA · PARTY ON · SAT 10/24 23:00` (ellipsis before the corner buttons) — with a 44 pt **✕** beside it.
4. **SAFARI-SAFE CANVAS** (`js/ui/canvas-safe.js`, the audit of every Harbor + reused district module): `ctx.filter` blur (the
   eclipse's corona sprite, the near rain streak) — Safari before 18 ignores it → `blurWorks()` tests it once by its pixels, the corona
   draws its soft streamers as three stacked strokes without it; `drawImage` with a source rect past the image (the banner's last slice
   ran 0.5 px past its panel; the water's mirror / column / texture reads could drift a fraction past their canvas) — older WebKit drew
   NOTHING → `blit()` clips the source rect and moves the destination to match; `getContext('2d')` returns null when iOS runs out of
   canvas memory → `ctx2d()` (the neon's sprites, the sky beams) never throws a frame. Not used anywhere in the Harbor: OffscreenCanvas,
   createImageBitmap, conic gradients, other canvas filters; composite modes used: `lighter`, `multiply`, `copy`, `destination-out`
   (all WebKit-safe).

### 0b. The sign names back to full size (the glance test)
Every named sign's letters ≥ 10 pt on every phone (tested: `harbor.test` "THE GLANCE TEST"), measured at 390 wide:
| sign | Neon Pass 4 | Neon Pass 5 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the left roof sign (`n-roof`) | 4.0–7.2 pt (RUMRUNNER 4.0) | **11.3–13.7** |
| the word towers' roof signs (`n-roofA/B`) | 5.8–8.8 | **10.7–13.4** |
| the game blade (`n-blade`) | 9.8–10.5 | **10.4–10.5** (letters 0.93 of a row) |
| PAR's narrow name (`n-par`, 10.5 pt wide) | 5.5–6.2 | **removed** — six stacked letters can't reach 10 pt in the room between PAR's roof and docked Rosie |
The three roof signs are **STACKED** (`spot.stack`, `signs.js`): the game's mark centred on top, the NAME across the cabinet's whole
width under it, the border tube 0.55 pt in; they take names of ≤ 6 letters (SIGNAL, CIPHER, STAKES, AGENT, BLUFF, PULSE, PRISM) — the
long ones (RUMRUNNER, GRIDLOCK, SLIPSTREAM, OVERCLOCK, NEON PAR) hang as icons or on the billboard. **THE BILLBOARD** (the owner's worst
offender): 65 × 41 pt (was 66 × 32; its right edge can't move — the old club stands in front past it), the mark small in its top-left
corner, the NAME across the whole board in the condensed UI face (Chakra Petch 700: a long name still reads) — PULSE ~14 pt caps.
The small icon LEFT OF THE WHEEL (`i-mid`) is gone (the owner). So a phone hangs 4 named + 6 icons = 10 games a night; the billboard
advertises a game with no sign tonight; the nightly shuffle rotates which (tested: over the nights every game has its sign).

### 0c. The party, polished
- **THE BEAT FOLLOWS THE REAL MUSIC** → `docs/audio.md#the-beat` (the grid offline, the kicks heard live, the clock, half-time). The
  old BPMs were plainly wrong for many songs (no better than chance against the onsets) — the main reason the beat "felt off".
  `PT.bar` counts REAL bars now (4 beats on the downbeats: scenes, drops, the searchlights' turn, the racers' reversals land on bar
  lines); `PT.beatsF` (the continuous beat) drives the racing + the wheel; `PT.punchAt(s)` (the punch's last second) lets the show's
  ripple roll across the skyline from the real punch.
- **HALF-TIME + A LONGER DECAY**: the punch lands on beats 1 + 3 (the downbeat ×1, beat 3 ×0.72), nothing on 2 + 4; a 50 ms attack, a
  0.24 s decay (was 0.14) — it punches instead of flickering.
- **THE ROTATING PARTY PALETTE** (`core/harbor-show.js#PARTY_PAL`, `partyColours`): six bright main colours — electric blue, gold, red,
  green, violet, pink — + WHITE as an accent only (a white tower read as no colour under the white-hot racing heads); every building a
  [main, accent] pair by its place left → right (neighbours never share a main), a NEW pair every scene (20–40 s), crossfading in a
  SWEEP across the skyline over the scene's last fifth (left → right, then right → left); a colour sweep / a strobe flashes the next
  pair early. The palette starts from the local half-hour (a 9 pm and a 1 am visit differ). Sprites: a building's pair built a few a
  frame (`neon.js#partySprite` — the next scene's from the scene's start; only its cur + next kept). The sky beams, the racing light,
  the wheel and the glass towers' LED facades take the same colours; the city's glow over the skyline is blue-violet / gold / red
  (was a pink wash: `sky.js`). Tier 0 keeps the baked party scheme (rebalanced: the same seven colours). An explicit scheme (a
  holiday) wins.
- **THE RACING LIGHT, readable**: a few LONG pulses a border (2–7, one every ~130 pt), each a white-hot head (+ a halo), a long tail in
  the building's own colour, the brighter last third near the head, a soft glow (tier 2) — LOCKED TO THE BAR: the pattern moves one
  spacing a bar (~65 pt/s at 120 bpm, ≈ half Neon Pass 4's 108–158 pt/s), easing ahead on beats 1 + 3; a third reverse every two bars.
  The tubes under a racer sink to 0.68 so it reads as colour, not a white wash. EVERY hero + word tower races its whole border in every
  scene (never one of the quarter that holds steady) and is first in line on tier 1 (`cast.order`). E2E at 402×874, 11 pm: ~20–40 % of
  the skyline's pixels change between frames 250 ms apart (Neon Pass 4: 10 %).
- **SKY BEAMS** (`skybeams.js`): every hero + word tower (6 on a phone, a dozen on desktop), behind the sign to the top, in the tower's
  palette colour (changing with the show), punching on the beat (0.55 → 1.3); the warm-up switches them on one by one 9 → 11 pm.
- **THE WHEEL AS A SHOWPIECE** (`wheel.js`): bigger, brighter bulbs (a hotter core), a wider soft halo round the rim, warm-lit gondolas
  (14 of 16, a warm pool of light round each cabin), a stronger haze; its bulbs drawn ONE BY ONE into its cache (≤ 30 a second, never
  a frame): a normal night — a gentle colour wave travelling round the rim (gold, rose, ice in turn, ~14 s a lap), a slow sparkle, a
  spiral out from the hub every ~40 s; a party night — a routine every 4 bars on the beat in the palette: a rainbow chase round the rim,
  the spokes lighting like a CLOCK HAND, SPIRALS, BURSTS from the hub on beats 1 + 3 (a big one on the drops), the wheel punching. Tier
  0 + reduced motion: the baked still bulbs.
- **THE NEON LOGO PUNCHES** on party nights (`ui/logo.js#logoGlowSvg`, `title.js#partyFrame`): its light alone (two blurred glows + a
  core) over the sign, faded in on the beat by opacity only (≤ 0.8: gentler than the skyline, the word stays readable), on the letters
  that are lit; SPEAKEASY keeps its own punch.
- **THE TIRED TUBE ROTATES** (`core/harbor-show.js#tiredLetters`, `title.js#tiredTick`): the O always looked "off" — it had NO hot spots
  (all smooth curves; N and E have two bright bends each: `logo.js#letterLight` now takes a letter's gentle bends when it has < 2 sharp
  ones: the O gets four). The tired look (a weaker core, softer glow, no hot spots) is its own class now: none / one / two letters in a
  3-hour block of the local clock, never a letter the block before had, the same on every phone. **RANDOM FLICKERS**: any letter, never
  the same twice running, sometimes two at once, rarely a whole letter out for a second; the boot's long stutter on a random letter
  (always the O before); the dusk warm-up + the dawn dying were already shuffled per day (`neon-ramp.js`).
- **REMOVED**: the speakeasy's roof STRING LIGHTS (the owner: Parts 7–8 first — `STRINGS_ON = false`, the code a hook,
  `&force=strings-party` still previews them); the small icon left of the wheel.

### 1d. The preview panel's sky events + PARTY ON
- A forced plane waited 9 s after the last forced one (PLANES then PLANE ON APPROACH got nothing) and for a FREE lane; the geese + the
  heron waited for a free lane while the planes held both for half a minute → **a forced piece overrides the gates** (a preview switched
  on resets the wait; a lane anyway).
- The SATELLITE TRAIN flew ONCE a page load (`trainNight = 'forced'`) — by day invisible, where it burned its one go → it comes again 3 s
  after each pass, visible in any sky when forced; from the panel it also jumps the clock to DUSK (its twilight).
- A NIGHT-ONLY event (☾) or PARTY ON switched on BY DAY with no time picked jumps the clock to tonight (22:30) — PARTY ON now shows exactly
  what the party link shows (E2E: the same beams, the palette, the peak).
- The sky lanes sit behind the open sheet (sky-low ~330–410 pt on a 390×844 phone, the sheet from ~280 pt) → switching a sky piece on
  makes the sheet PEEK (a third of the screen for ~9 s; a touch on the sheet brings it back up).
- E2E: every sky piece fired through the panel appears within 6 s — by day: banner, skywriting, skytyping, helicopter, balloons, the
  festival, planes, the approach, geese, swifts, bats at dusk, the heron; at night: the satellite train, the drone show.

### Performance (A-B-B-A against b865eb0, 4× CPU, the laptop without a GPU, 402 × 874; ms of scene work a frame)
The laptop was heavily loaded all afternoon (the old code's own numbers came out ~5–8× this morning's), so only A vs B in the same
round means anything. Means of the two runs each:
| scene | tier 2 | tier 1 | tier 0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `np-party` (Sat 23:00, the peak) | 64.7 → **92.9** | 44.5 → **36.2** (both stepped down mid-run) | 17.6 → **17.2** |
| `np-night` | 35.4 → **44.3** | ~24 → **31.2** (noisy: stepping) | 13.6 → **13.0** |

**ONE FIX** after the round: the wheel on a normal night draws its baked bulbs as the base and only the bulbs that differ (the wave, a
sparkle, the spiral) on top (~15 draws a refresh, not ~170), the faintest party bulbs skipped, only the brightest bloomed; the racing
light's wide glow only round the head's bright third. **Re-measured A → B:** night t2 36.9 → **26.6** (now cheaper than before this
pass), party t2 62.6 → **90.5** (still ~+45 %: the palette's crossfades, the longer racers on every tower, the wheel's party routines),
party t0 17.5 → **14.9**. Reported, not chased: **the owner's iPhone decides** (`&debug=1`, read after 10–15 s on a party night). If her
tier 2 shows slow frames there, the next steps: the racers' glow off at tier 2, the wheel's party refresh 30 → 20 a second, racing on
the hero + word towers only. Memory: the palette's pair sprites ≈ the outlines' own (~2–4 MB at tier 2, 2 pairs a building at most).

### Known issues (NEON PASS 5)
- **WebKit not run here**: the Playwright WebKit install fails on this machine (the zip downloads, the extraction fails — twice). The
  Safari fixes above come from the code + what's known about Safari, reproduced in Chromium (the 30 Hz tier probe). **The owner's
  iPhone check** (`&debug=1`): the readout's first line `t2 · dpr 2` (and `capped 30 Hz` in Low Power Mode — the tier must stay 2), the
  racing on every tower's border at 11 pm, six beams, the colours changing every ~half minute, the panel's chip + ✕.
- **The beat by ear**: checked by numbers (the grid vs the onsets offline; real songs in headless Chrome: 63–78 % of the heard kicks on
  the grid's beats), not by ear — **play music on the iPhone** at a party link. Bluetooth's delay is compensated only as far as the
  browser reports `outputLatency`.
- The MOOD MUSIC follows the real time (`audio/mood.js`): PARTY ON from the panel on a Thursday plays the day's mood songs — they have
  grids too, so the beat locks anyway.
- 10 of 12 games have a sign a night on a phone (the billboard an 11th); long names (≥ 7 letters) never get a named sign now.
- The E2E's RE-LAYOUT check now starts once its pixel holds steady for 8 frames (under load the stage was still settling after the
  first bakes when it began — never a blank frame; logged after two attempts at a deeper cause). PERF fails on the bench (as in Neon
  Pass 4); BATTERY passes alone but can drop under its 22 fps floor when the laptop is this loaded.
- The party moves a lot more (20–40 % of the skyline's pixels between frames 250 ms apart, was 10 %) — check it isn't too busy.
- The palette's warm half (red, violet, pink) next to each other reads pinkish for a scene; it changes in 20–40 s.

### Handoff → THE DAY PASS
The night + the party are done for now. The Day Pass rebuilds the day (plan.md); nothing here draws by day but the stacked roof signs'
unlit glass + the billboard's paint (their day faces are the Day Pass's — it uses the same sizes). Part 10 (fireworks + the finale):
`PT.bar` is real bars now (`PT.drop` / `PT.big` on bar lines), `PT.punchAt(s)`, `harbor().skyBeams.set`, the wheel's party routines
(`wheel.js#drawBulbs` — a finale routine is one more `mode`). Part 7–8: `STRINGS_ON` in scene.js. Preview links
(`?city=2&tz=America/Detroit&at=42.96,-85.67&debug=1&when=…`): a normal night `2026-10-22T22:00`, the party `2026-10-24T21:00` / `T23:00`
/ `2026-10-25T01:00`, the boot-up `2026-10-19T18:20&speed=20`.
