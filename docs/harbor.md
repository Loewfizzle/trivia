# CITY 2.0 — THE HARBOR (the bible)

The title's new city, replacing today's district (`js/screens/district/`). A once-only, never-redo build with an uncompromising
quality bar, in 12 parts. **Every later part follows this file.** Until Part 12 switches it over, the Harbor lives behind
`?city=2` only; a normal visit gets today's city, exactly as before. Rollback point: the git tag **`city-1.0`** (pushed Oct 20 2026).

## The vision
A 1920s Art Deco city in heavy neon, across a harbor, that is LIVE to the player's own place and time — their real sun, moon,
stars, weather, seasons, holidays, party nights — and **we never tell them; they discover it.** Weather effects only when it is
really happening.

- **iPhone held upright is the baseline and the majority.** Design every pixel for 390–430 pt wide first. Desktop is a minority
  but must look just as good: a wider panorama with more to see, never a stretched phone.
- **Quality bar: STUNNING.** Nothing may look cheap, day or night. DAY and NIGHT must feel like two different cities — the same
  city, two totally different vibes. At golden hour, rays of sunlight stream between the buildings as the sun passes behind
  them; real shadows and textures everywhere. Night neon is a show-stopper, party nights jaw-dropping, holiday details insanely good.
- The Harbor is **its own city** — not tied to or branded off any one game (RUMRUNNER included).
- Keep **ALWAYS NIGHT** (seasons + holidays still show). Keep the **audio logic exactly as it is** (MOOD MUSIC by time of day, the
  lobby's synced song, each game's music); the music + menu buttons stay where they are.

## The owner's decisions (Oct 20 2026)
- **THE REFERENCE IS THE FLOOR, NOT THE CEILING.** `docs/harbor/ref/` (`city2-harbor.png` night + day, `city2-harbor-closeup.png`,
  `river2.js` — the approved mockup renderer, city "harbor2") locks the layout, camera, proportions and mood. Every piece in the
  real build must clearly beat its mockup version in craft, detail, texture and light — never match it and stop. Port the
  NUMBERS only: never import, copy-paste or serve anything from `docs/harbor/ref/` (it is in `.vercelignore`); use the app's real
  fonts. The mockup's numbers are CSS pt at 402×874.
- **Layout:** the skyline across the harbor (lots of sky above for the sun's arch, moon, stars); a pier with a Ferris wheel on the
  left; a lighthouse in open water on the right with a keeper's cottage; boats (the riverboat "Rosie" with bulbs, a water taxi, a
  tug, sailboats by day); then the near STAGE: a waterside road (two stop lights, a bus, cars) behind a promenade nearest the
  viewer (lamp + tree pairs incl. trees at the front corners, a bench, planters, a seasonal vendor cart, people), and the
  SPEAKEASY on our side bleeding off the left edge (windows you can see into, the unmarked door, a crafted awning "EST. 1924", a
  visible rooftop with planters and string lights). The promenade at night needs rich lamp light (it was too dark in the mockup).
  The skyline has real gaps and varied heights along the sun's path so golden-hour rays can stream between buildings (planned now:
  `SUN_GAPS`).
- **The skyline vs the sign (asked + decided Oct 20 2026):** with the real sign, the mockup's tallest towers would rise 23–63 pt
  into the tagline. The camera stays the mockup's (so the water, road, promenade and the size rules are exactly as approved) and
  the skyline is SQUEEZED: the tall towers shrink more than the low ones so the skyline keeps its dramatic peaks and never looks
  squat or flat-topped; the landmark towers stay the tallest; the tallest crown stops 10 pt under the tagline; the freed sky is
  the sun's arch.
- **A phone sideways (asked + decided):** the whole city, smaller (the wide camera; people ~9 pt). The size rules are for the phone
  held upright.
- **SIZE RULES** on a ~402 pt-wide iPhone: people ~20 pt tall (hats, scarves, coats readable by shape + colour), cars ~50–60 pt
  long, the bus ~110 pt, lamps ~45–55 pt, tree canopies ~40 pt, stop lights ~55 pt (heads 1.3× real size, bright, with glow +
  wet reflection). Far skyline windows are glitter (no detail expected; distant brick and blinds must never read as lit windows by
  day); the near stage is where life happens; **nothing alive under the dock**; every new feature gets a size check (pt on a real
  phone) before it is built. **"If it would look flat in a photo, it isn't done":** every surface gets texture, relief and shadow.
- **HERO PIECES = everything that draws the eye, no exceptions:** everything that moves (planes, the banner plane, helicopters,
  jets, birds / gulls / wildlife, the UFO, satellites, boats, the bus, cars, trucks, plows, people) plus the landmarks (the
  speakeasy, the Ferris wheel, the lighthouse, the pier, the landmark towers) and every sign and billboard. Each is crafted like an
  illustration (real shading, detail, light) and reviewed up close by day and by night. The existing sky systems keep their
  behaviour (flight paths, schedules, real-sky timing); their ARTWORK is rebuilt to this standard in Part 6.
- **SIGNS:** built like the NEON logo (`ui/logo.js` — bent glass tubes: glass body, near + wide glow, white-hot core, highlight,
  electrode caps, clips), real cabinets with depth, brackets, chaser bulbs; each game has its own neon sign in the city (and its own
  tube logo, reused later by the lobby's sign swap); beautiful unlit by day (clear glass, sun glints, weathered paint, cast shadows).
- **Depth + contrast so neon pops:** 4–5 skyline depth layers with atmospheric haze, dark mid-ground silhouettes, a horizon glow,
  floodlit crowns, reflections in the harbor, bloom.
- **Holidays:** the US set (Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, NYE, Valentine's, St. Patrick's, Easter, July 4th) + Memorial Day
  and Veterans Day (American flags in windows and on buildings — also for July 4th — and a Veterans Day flyover) + Day of the Dead.
  **Party nights** (Fri/Sat) build all night: classy warm-up → spectacle at the peak → the midnight finale. **Hidden tappable easter
  eggs**, never explained, from common to legendary (some once a year), incl. a few subtle, rare nods to the owner's home town,
  Grand Rapids.
- **Sound:** nothing may rely on a subtle sound (the music is loud) — important moments use a music change, a short duck, or crisp
  on-beat hits, always with a strong visual. With the music OFF, a premium, relaxing city soundscape plays instead (a distant
  foghorn, gulls, an occasional far-off honk, light traffic, a soft city hum; a night version) — never cheap (Part 12).
- **Accessibility + modes:** respect prefers-reduced-motion (a calm, still-beautiful version); Low Power / low tiers degrade
  gracefully (fewer moving things, never a broken or ugly city); the Dynamic Island / notch and home-indicator safe areas; a phone
  turned sideways (the wide camera; never a broken layout).
- **Future growth** (room designed now, built later): parades, a rooftop party / summer rooftop garden at the speakeasy, the
  banner plane (daily challenges, holiday messages, game announcements, July 4th F-16s), a party yacht with a helicopter landing,
  a snowman through a snowy day, the player's own figure walking into the speakeasy, the city "remembering" the day; **LOBBY 2.0**
  (the live city IS the lobby: guests as figures on the promenade outside the speakeasy door; on start the sign swaps to the
  game's neon logo and everyone walks inside), **BOARD 2.0** (the bar inside the speakeasy, its windows looking out on the live
  Harbor), **PROGRESSION 2.0** (levels 1–100, a wardrobe whose pieces turn neon at night, entrances), a future single-player mode /
  daily challenges (keep a doorway for them: the events system's lanes). Every future addition meets the same quality bar.

## The 12 parts
| # | part | what |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **foundation + blockout** ✅ | the flag, the projector + per-size camera, the layout, baking + the memory budget, lanes + events, the &grid overlay, a grey box of the whole approved layout, tests, this file |
| 2 | skyline | the far bands, the mid band, the facades (glitter windows, real brick/stone/glass by day), the haze, the floodlit crowns, the golden-hour rays through the sun gaps |
| 3 | neon + signs + billboards | the tube signs (each game's own), the hotel's blade, the roof tubes (JAZZ, PULSE, NEON PAR…), billboards; unlit by day |
| 4 | water | reflections in perspective, ripples, the lights' smears, the quay lamps in the water, wakes |
| 5 | harbor hero pieces | the Ferris wheel (turning, bulbs), the lighthouse (the beam), the pier, the landmark towers, the boats (Rosie and her bulbs, the taxi, the tug, the sailboats) |
| 6 | sky hero pieces | planes, the banner plane, the helicopter, jets, birds / gulls, the UFO, satellites — the existing systems' behaviour, new artwork |
| 7 | the speakeasy | the facade, rooms you can see into, the door + the knock, the awning "EST. 1924", the rooftop (planters, string lights, people) |
| 8 | the stage | the promenade, lamps, trees, bench, planters, the cart, people who walk, the road, the bus, cars, stop lights (cycle, wet reflections) |
| 9 | seasons + weather | the trees through the year, snow on everything, rain and puddles, fog, frost; the city's materials in each |
| 10 | holidays + the banner plane | every holiday in the list, flags, the Veterans Day flyover; the banner plane's messages |
| 11 | party nights | the warm-up → the peak → the midnight finale on the Harbor; `partyLight()` for the lobby's still |
| 12 | easter eggs + sounds + memory + desktop + switch-over | the eggs (common → legendary), the music-off soundscape, the city remembering the day, the desktop pass, the switch to default + the backdrop (menus' still) |

## The flag
- `?city=2` is a plain URL flag only. It is read once in `js/screens/title.js` (one top-level line: the harbor module is imported
  only when the flag is in the URL — a normal visit never requests a harbor file) and the scene is created with one gated line:
  `scene = (createHarbor || createDistrict)(…)`. Never saved to localStorage, cookies, the profile or Firebase; never in a menu;
  kept in the address bar by `identity.js#setUrlRoom` (like `pdperf`), so a dev session stays on the Harbor across a refresh, a
  rejoin and back to the title;
  the service worker caches files by URL and never a default path (`sw.js` is network-first, no precache list — nothing to change).
- Every title flag works with it: `&when &tz &at &wx &rained &wind &speed &force` (core/sky.js#skyClock), `&intro &idle` (under `?emu`).
- Harbor-only flags: **`&grid=1`** (the dev overlay: the safe areas, the sign + tagline, the skyline limit + the squeeze, the
  sun's arch band + the roofline + the sun now, the sun gaps, the eight lane rects (dashed, named), the door's tap target,
  size boxes: a 20 pt person at z 47 and a 110 pt bus at z 60), **`&debug=1`** (logs the camera, the layout and every bake with the
  memory per layer), **`&force=demo`** (the demo event, end to end).
- Previews: `tests/integration/title-preview.html?city=2&…` (no Firebase); shots: `node shots.mjs "<browser>" --preview --city 2
  --safe --sizes harbor --scenes day,golden,night,party,rain,snow` (`--crop stage`); perf: `node title-perf.mjs "<browser>" --city 2`.

## The architecture (Part 1)
```
js/core/harbor-layout.js   PURE  the projector, the camera per screen, the SIZE table, the squeeze, the sun gaps, the whole layout, screen boxes, the roofline, the lane rects
js/core/harbor-events.js   PURE  lanes + events, the stateful scheduler (anchor + replay, budgets, rarity, heavy events → density), the built-in events
js/screens/harbor/scene.js        createHarbor(): the district's API; the frame; the sky modules wired in; rainbows + party rules; the dock's rects
js/screens/harbor/bake.js         the baker: two sets of canvases, chunked steps, the crossfade, the memory budget
js/screens/harbor/tones.js        Part 1's day / sunset / night tints (from the real sky's weights) + the haze by depth
js/screens/harbor/shapes.js       world-space drawing: boxes (the faces the camera sees), crowns, people, vehicles
js/screens/harbor/blocks.js       a skyline building (grey box + glitter windows), a band in chunks, a haze veil
js/screens/harbor/sky.js          the sky's gradient + horizon glow (the real sky on it = the district's sky modules)
js/screens/harbor/far.js mid.js landmarks.js quay.js water.js pier.js lighthouse.js boats.js road.js speakeasy.js stage.js foreground.js   the layers, far → near
js/screens/harbor/grid.js         the &grid=1 overlay
```
- **The same public API as `createDistrict`** (title.js / title-dock.js / backdrop.js use it): `set, look, hit, signOn, palette,
  signCol, refresh, safeTop, safeBottom, state, setTier, tier(), sun, neonMoments, signCount, now, speed, skyline, frames, cost,
  party, finale, partyLight, street, knock, door, rainbow, debug, destroy` + `harbor()` (City 2.0 only; `__district.harbor()`).
- **The sky modules are REUSED, called as they are** (district/): `stars, fx (back + front), sun (draw, through, halo, rays, dim,
  moments), aircraft, weather-fx (sky, fogLayer, flash, moonVeil), rain (veils, drops), wildlife (sky, low), frost (pane),
  fireworks, rainbow (update, sky), live-weather, palette`. They get `resize(W, H, HZ)` with HZ = the far quay's waterline and the
  same frame object (`fs`) the district builds, incl. `skyline` (the Harbor's roofline: the sun fits its arch to it, the planes
  keep above it).
- **Draw order:** the sky (gradient, stars, the moon + sky fx, the sun, planes, clouds, rain veils, the rainbow, birds,
  fireworks) → **far** (haze band, far band, mid band) → the sun's halo + rays, swifts, fog → **near** (landmarks, near band, hero
  blocks, the quay + its lamps) → **water** → **harbor** (pier, wheel, breakwater, lighthouse, cottage) → boats → **road** → traffic →
  **stage** (promenade, stop lights, speakeasy, lamps, trees, bench, planters, cart) → people → lights (lamps, stop lights, the
  knock) → rain drops, snow, the flash, frost, the eclipse → the vignette → &grid. **Bold** = baked.
- **Baking:** each baked layer is a full-width band of the screen (only its rows), drawn per LOOK KEY (Part 1: the tone weights in
  sixths + the camera) in small steps — `TIERS[tier].bakeMs` (2 / 3 / 4 ms) a frame, never a blocked frame — into the second set,
  then crossfaded in over 1.2 s and swapped. Progressive start: the sky draws from the first frame; the city fades in (0.7 s)
  when its first bake is done (≈ 6–10 frames). A moved rect (the title reports the sign's and the dock's real rects a frame after
  mount and every 500 ms), a resize or a tier change re-lays the city. **A re-layout never blanks it:** `plan()` keeps each
  group's current canvas and `ready`, with the band it was baked for (`show`); the scene draws that stale layer — in its old band
  when the pixel size is unchanged, stretched into the new band after a resize or a tier change — until the new bake swaps in,
  then the crossfade (from `prev`). Only `next` (the bake target) is resized, when a bake starts; `settle()` gives the spare
  canvas its group's size again after the crossfade (and after the first bake), so the steady state is two sets at the current
  size. A bake never starts during a crossfade (its source is `next`): the look's rebake waits, a re-layout's bake is queued
  (`wantBake`). The sign or the corner buttons moving without the city moving only re-computes the lanes (no bake).
- **Memory budget** (`bake.js#MEM_BUDGET_MB`): all baked layers (both sets) ≤ **24 / 40 / 64 MB** at tier 0 / 1 / 2. Baked layers
  are capped at DPR 2 (the main canvas's own DPR: tier 2 = 2, so DPR 3 bakes would be downsampled anyway; a DPR-3 stage is possible
  later only together with a DPR-3 main canvas — measure first). Over budget, the tallest layers step down to DPR 1.5, then 1.
  Measured: 15.6 MB at 390×844 tier 2 (+ the main canvas 5.3 MB), 13.3 MB at 1440×900. Canvases are reused on a re-bake, never
  more than two sets, and `destroy()` sets every canvas to 0×0. The E2E proves 20 title ↔ setup cycles leave the same MB and no
  growing heap.

## The camera + the layout (Part 1 numbers)
World units: x right, y up, z away; the camera at x = 0, CAMH up, level. `sx = VPX + F·x/z`, `sy = VPY + F·(CAMH − y)/z`.
- **The mockup (402×874):** VPY 540, CAMH 13.5, F 600. Visible half-width = 0.335·z. Ground: y = 540 + 8100/z.
- **Upright phone:** F = 600 · W / 402 (390–430 keep the same composition), CAMH 13.5, VPY = dock top − 4 − F·CAMH/36.5 (the
  front row stands 4 pt above the dock). The squeeze limit = tagline bottom + 10. Measured (real title, iPhone safe areas):

| size | F | VPY | squeeze s | person | bus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 390×844 | 582 | 509 | 0.55 | 19.2 pt | 107 pt |
| 402×874 | 600 | 532 | 0.52 | 19.8 pt | 110 pt |
| 412×915 | 615 | 568 | 0.76 | 20.3 pt | 113 pt |
| 430×932 | 642 | 575 | 0.66 | 21.1 pt | 118 pt |
| 874×402 (sideways) | 270 | 262 | 0.28 | 8.9 pt | 50 pt |
| 1440×900 | 604 | 566 | 0.52 | 19.9 pt | 111 pt |

- **Wide (desktop, sideways):** room = dock top − 4 − tagline bottom − 10; F = max(600 · room / 411, people ≥ 9 pt), CAMH =
  min(13.5, 0.55 (0.4 when the room is short) · room · 36.5 / F). A panorama: the harbor pieces spread (× up to 2.2), the skyline
  bands are generated across the whole width, more landmarks further out, the promenade repeats to the right edge, and a FRONT ROW
  (z 28–33: lamp + tree pairs, benches, people) lives either side of the dock (never under it).
- **The squeeze** (`squeeze(cam, yMax)`): above a knee (55 % of the way from the limit down to the horizon; lower for a short
  strip of sky) the height above the knee is scaled by s with a soft start, so the highest top (crown included) lands on the limit.
  Monotonic (taller stays taller), low roofs untouched.
- **Depths:** haze band z 620–820; far band 380–560; mid band 300–360; landmarks 255–290 (+14 deep, tiers step in 26 % and back
  1.3); near band 232–250; hero blocks + the far quay 230 (top 0.4, foot −1.2; lamps every 11); water 64–230; railing z 64 (y 1.1);
  road z 54–64 (lane at 59); promenade z 30–54; the speakeasy z 44–60, 10.5 tall, 11.2 wide, its x0 28 pt past the left edge.
- **Landmarks** (x, w, z, h + crown): sunburst 30/13/255/112+13 · needle 56/11/280/100+18 (spire) · pyramid 4/10/290/86+10 ·
  dome −26/11/280/78+6 (2 tiers) · mast −64/11/270/92+14. **Hero blocks:** hotel 12..26 z230 h36 (blade sign) · PULSE −14..2
  z233 h28 · NEON PAR 38..56 z234 h32 · JAZZ −50..−38 z230 h30 (roof tubes).
- **Harbor:** pier x −34..−20 (× spread) z 140–230, deck y 2.4, pilings every 6, lamps every 9; Ferris wheel (−24, 23, z 165) r 17,
  18 spokes, 18 gondolas; breakwater around the lighthouse z 150; lighthouse x 46 z 150 h 26 (r 2.4 → 1.7, bands at 25–38 % and
  60–73 %, gallery, lantern, dome); the keeper's cottage beside it. Boats: Rosie x 4 z 128 (26 long, decks, the stack), taxi
  (32, z 100), the tug at night / a sailboat by day (−60, z 190), a second sailboat by day (70, z 200).
- **Stage** (positions relative to the speakeasy's right face, −5.6 on the phone): stop lights at +2.6 (dir 1) and +18.1 (dir −1),
  z 54.6; the bus +13.6 z 60; cars +20.1 z 57.5, −2.4 z 57, −9.4 z 61; lamps +2 / +11 / +18.2 z 47 and +14.2 z 37; trees +4.4 / +15.4
  z 47.3, the front corners at z 37.4 (right: 84 % of the half-width; left: −6); bench +12.8 z 47.8; planters +0.2 / +6 z 43; the
  cart +9.2 z 37.6; people: at the cart, the doorman by the door, a couple, a dog walker, the cab hail, a stroller, a walker.
- **The SIZE table** (`SIZE`, pt at the reference phone at the thing's usual depth → `units(name)` world units): person 20 @ z 47
  (1.57 u), car 55 @ 58, bus 110 @ 60 (11 u), lamp 50 @ 47, canopy 40 @ 47, stop light 55 @ 54.6.
- **The sun gaps** (`SUN_GAPS`, screen fraction / width pt): 0.06/7, 0.13/9, 0.31/6, 0.70/6, 0.79/9, 0.90/8, 0.97/6 — no skyline
  band block covers one (tested); the landmarks and hero blocks stand clear of them.
- **The door:** the front face's u 9.05–10.55, 2.6 tall; the tap target ≥ 44 × 44 pt around it (on screen, clear of the dock and
  the corner buttons — tested at every size).

## Lanes + events (`js/core/harbor-events.js`)
- **Lanes:** `sky-high, sky-low, skyline, water, road, promenade, windows, rooftop` — each a PLACE: `core/harbor-layout.js#laneRects`
  gives every lane a screen rect (`L.lanes`, pt), where its events draw:

| lane | rect | 390×844 (iPhone safe areas) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sky-high` | safe top + 4 .. the neon's top − 4, stopping 4 pt left of the corner buttons — the banner plane's strip | 0,66 · 330×100 |
| `sky-low` | the tagline's bottom + 4 .. the roofline's median (things here pass BEHIND the taller roofs); `y0NoTag` = the word's bottom + 4, for when Part 2 fades the tagline | 0,329 · 390×≈80 |
| `skyline` | the skyline limit .. the far quay | full width |
| `water` | the tallest boat's top .. the railing | full width |
| `road` | a bus's top on the far lane .. the near kerb | full width |
| `promenade` | a float two people tall at the far edge .. the dock's top (never under it) | full width |
| `windows` / `rooftop` | the speakeasy's upper front face / the space over its roof (clipped to the screen) | — |

  The lanes overlap where one lane's things stand in front of the next (boats over the skyline's feet, floats over the road).
  `LANE_MIN` / `laneMin(cam, id)`: sky-high ≥ 40 pt, sky-low ≥ 24 (screen pt); the world lanes scale with the city (a phone
  sideways: smaller). Tested at the six sizes: on screen, tall enough, clear of the neon, the word, the tagline, the corner
  buttons and the dock; the E2E checks them against the real sign. The sign's rects come from the title (`textRects`, the
  corner buttons from `clear`); when they move and the city doesn't, only the lanes are re-computed (no bake).
- **An event:** `{ id, lanes, when(ctx), rarity: common | weekly | rare | legendary, duration (≤ 8 slots), cost (ms/frame), heavy?, seed }`
  — `defineEvent()` checks it. ctx = `ctxAt(ms)` — **a function of ms only** (the replay asks it about the past): Part 1.5 has
  `{ ms, force }`; Part 6 adds the sun / season / holiday at that moment from core/sky.js.
- **The scheduler is STATE** (`createScheduler(events, ctxAt, { seed, forced, anchor })`): time is cut into 90 s slots; each slot
  rolls its own dice from the slot number + the seed. What slot n admits depends on what still runs from earlier slots, so the
  past is decided ONCE: the scene makes one scheduler when it first reads the look, anchored at **the local midnight one day
  back** (`anchorFor(ms, LK.local)`), replays to now once (≤ 1920 slots, a fraction of a ms per slot), then `at(clock.now())`
  every 500 ms decides only the new slots (`&speed` just decides them faster; a jump of more than two days starts over a day
  back). Schedulers with different anchors (a session that crossed midnight vs. a fresh load) agree from the first slot both find
  the lanes free — tested: identical an hour after midnight. `schedule(events, ms, ctxAt)` is the from-scratch form (tests,
  previews; anchor = the UTC midnight a day back). Rules per slot: an eligible event starts with chance `slot / period`
  (common: every ~4 slots; weekly: once a week; rare: once a month; legendary: once a year). Rarer first; never two events in
  one lane at once; one of each at a time; the frame budget `BUDGET` (2.5 ms in all, 1.5 per lane) holds; only one heavy event
  at a time. Forced ids (previews) start in every slot, first.
- **Heavy events thin the others:** a heavy event quiets every lane it does not use (`quiet`); the scene turns that into
  `fs.density` (`densityOf`: 1, or `QUIET` = 0.3 in a quiet lane). The district's modules read it when the scene passes it (the
  default city never does, so nothing changes there): the planes (`aircraft.js`: max planes × density — no new plane in a quiet
  sky), the geese + the heron (no new flock while the sky is quiet), the swifts (the skyline lane), the cars (`drawTraffic`: that
  share of the cars; the bus stays).
- **Part 1's only event:** `demo` (lane `sky-low`, debug-only, `&force=demo`) — a labelled lantern crossing the middle of the
  sky-low rect, proving the pipeline end to end (scene → scheduler → `harbor().events` → drawn in its lane).
- Tests (`tests/harbor.test.mjs`): `schedule(t)` and `schedule(t − SLOT_MS)` agree on every event spanning both; the stateful
  scheduler sampled every 30 s for 3000 slots of a contended case (5 sky events of 4 slots, 5 water events of 6, 3 heavy
  parade-length events of 8 in the promenade) never pops an event in or drops one, and matches a fresh replay; anchors a day
  apart agree; lanes, budget, heavy, rarity, `when()`, forced.

## Performance
- **Baseline: today's city** (`title-perf.mjs`, 390×844 at DPR 3 capped to the tier, Chrome, 4× CPU, Oct 20 2026), the scene's own
  draw cost per frame (mean / p50 / p95): **party peak** t2 8.9 / 8.8 / 10.7 ms · t1 10.3 / 10.2 / 12.7 · t0 6.4 / 6.2 / 8.0;
  night t2 6.6 · t1 6.0 · t0 5.4; day t2 4.4 · t1 5.7 · t0 5.4. Frames held 16.7 ms everywhere.
- **Budgets for City 2.0** (phone, 4× CPU): **tier 2 ≤ 8 ms** of scene work a frame on average, 60 fps; **tier 1 ≤ 6 ms** (DPR
  1.5, fewer moving things, no bloom passes over the whole screen); **tier 0 ≤ 4 ms** (DPR 1, the calm city: the baked layers +
  the lights; moving things thinned to a few, effects off — never broken, never ugly). The scene steps down a tier when the
  75th-percentile frame passes 19.5 ms (like the district). Each later part measures before it builds and keeps these.
- **Part 1 measured:** t2 3.2 ms · t1 3.1 · t0 2.9 (party), 3.0 / 2.8 / 2.7 (day) on the same bench; the E2E's party peak at 4×
  CPU: t2 4.5 · t1 3.9 · t0 3.7 ms — 60 fps at every tier.
- **First visit** (ROADMAP "First-visit speed"): profiled Oct 20 2026 — TAP TO ENTER is up at **0.49 s** cold in e2e-title (the
  1.5 s target is met; the ~2.2 s noted on Oct 20 does not reproduce — the commits of that week note absolute timings moving with
  the machine's load). At 4× CPU a cold start: today's city 1.40 s (its first build + frame is one 645 ms task), the Harbor 1.21 s
  (372 ms: the layout + the sky + the first frame; the city itself bakes in small steps AFTER the first frame). The rest is the
  browser's own work (style, layout, paint, compile ~1 s at 4×). `core/sky.js#localParts` (Intl formatToParts, ~60 ms at 4×) is
  the biggest JS item in both; caching its formatter did not help (the parts call dominates) and was not kept. City 2.0 never
  blocks the first frame on the city.

## Stubs — to come in Part N
| API / piece | Part 1 | built in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signCount()` → 0, `debug().signs` [], `hit` never returns `sign` | the neon ramp plans the logo only | 3 |
| the hero blocks' signs (a frame where each goes) | outline | 3 |
| the water: a flat band | no reflections | 4 |
| the wheel, the lighthouse, the pier, the boats, the landmarks | grey boxes, still | 5 |
| the sky's artwork (planes, birds, the UFO — `fx.mid` is not called, so the cat / UFO / window glyphs don't show yet) | the district's art | 6 |
| the speakeasy (rooms, the door's craft, the knock's peephole: a warm flash only) | grey box | 7 |
| `street()` → the stage's layout (lamps, signals, door, knocks); people + traffic still | placeholders | 8 |
| seasons on the trees, snow on the city, puddles | autumn always | 9 |
| holidays (the sky fx's holiday pieces already run) | — | 10 |
| `partyLight()` → null, no party searchlights / windows (the party's numbers + the finale's fireworks + `onParty` work) | rules only | 11 |
| the menus' backdrop (`district/backdrop.js` still images today's city when no title was shown) | today's city | 12 |
| the music-off soundscape, the easter eggs, the switch-over | — | 12 |

## Part 1 progress / handoff
- [x] 0. Safety: `city-1.0` tagged at ba51ee2 and pushed; `docs/harbor/ref` kept out of the deploy (`.vercelignore`).
- [x] Reading (subagents): title.js / title-dock / backdrop contract, district scene + sky modules, the mockup's numbers, docs + tests.
- [x] Rule conflict asked + decided (the squeeze; sideways = smaller).
- [x] Perf baseline (`title-perf.mjs`), first-visit profile.
- [x] `core/harbor-layout.js`, `core/harbor-events.js` + `tests/harbor.test.mjs` (22 tests).
- [x] `screens/harbor/*` (scene, baker, layers, grid), title.js's flag line + `__district.harbor()`.
- [x] Review: six scenes × six sizes, two refine passes (the wide front row, night water; the lamps' pools, the stop lights' glow).
- [x] `shots.mjs --city 2 --safe --sizes harbor --crop stage` + party / snow scenes; `e2e-harbor.mjs` (16 checks).
- [x] Docs: this file, CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, roadmap-history.md, testing.md.
- (Superseded by Part 1.5's handoff below.) Next: **Part 2 — the skyline.** Start from `far.js / mid.js / blocks.js / landmarks.js / quay.js` and the `SUN_GAPS`; keep the
  squeeze and the camera; measure with `title-perf.mjs --city 2` before and after.

## Part 1.5 — foundation fixes (Oct 21 2026)
Plumbing only, no new visuals (the `&grid=1` lane rects aside); every Part 1 number and size kept. Review findings 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
fixed; 1, 4, 5 are Part 2's (below).
- [x] #2 the scheduler is state (`createScheduler`), replayed once from the local midnight a day back, advanced slot by slot.
- [x] #3 a re-layout keeps the stale layers drawn until the new bake swaps in; rebakes wait for the crossfade.
- [x] #6 lane rects in the layout (`L.lanes`, `laneRects`), tested; `fs.density` thins the planes, birds, swifts and cars.
- [x] #7 landmark tiers projected in the world (`skyBlock` takes `y0`).
- [x] #8 `city=2` stays in the URL through `setUrlRoom` (refresh, rejoin, back to the title).
- Tests: `tests/harbor.test.mjs` 27 (+ the scheduler's pop-in, span, anchor and density tests, the lanes at six sizes);
  `e2e-harbor.mjs` 20 checks (+ the lanes against the real sign, `setTier(1)` never blanks the stage, the URL keeps the flag).
- **Next: Part 2 — the skyline.** Start with findings **1** (choose the sun gaps against the whole silhouette: bands + landmarks +
  heroes + the panorama's mirrored landmarks, and test that), **4** (clip the blocks at a corridor, don't drop them; pad 2 pt) and
  **5** (a per-building window grid `win: { cols, rows, u0, v0, pitch }` and a lit pass outside the look-key bake; drop `h` from
  the glitter seed). Then `far.js / mid.js / blocks.js / landmarks.js / quay.js`; keep the squeeze and the camera; measure with
  `title-perf.mjs --city 2` before and after. Events that need a moment's sky (night, season) add it to the scene's `ctxAt` as a
  function of ms only (the replay asks about the past).

## Review findings (Part 1)
Read-only review of Part 1 against this file (Oct 21 2026): the camera + layout numbers at the six sizes, the scene API against
title.js / title-dock.js / backdrop.js, the baker + the budget, the scheduler, the flag, and what Parts 2–12 will hit. The camera
table above checks out at every size (F, VPY, the squeeze, people, the bus); the API matches every call the title makes; the flag
is never saved; the 22 tests pass. Ranked, real problems only (what Part 2 already plans is left out):

1. **→ Part 2.** **The landmark towers and a hero block stand ON three of the seven sun gaps, on every phone** — the claim above ("the landmarks
   and hero blocks stand clear of them") is false and the test only checks the bands (`harbor-layout.js#harborLayout`: only
   `band()` calls `inGap`; `tests/harbor.test.mjs` "the sun gaps stay clear"). At 390×844 the sunburst (x 249–278) covers the gap
   at 273 (f 0.70), the needle (300–323) and NEON PAR (290–334) cover 308 (f 0.79), the mast (45–69) covers 51 (f 0.13); at
   1440×900 the mirrored sunburst covers 1008. And since the rays are drawn between the `far` and `near` layers (scene.js#draw),
   the near layers are exactly what occludes them — these are the gaps that matter. **Fix (Part 2, before the rays):** choose the
   corridors against the whole silhouette (bands + landmarks + heroes + the panorama's mirrored landmarks): e.g. 0.13 → ~0.19,
   0.70 → ~0.73 (12 pt free between the sunburst's 278 and PAR's 290 at 390), drop or move 0.79; and test
   `[...bands, ...landmarks, ...heroes]`, not `L.bands`.
2. **FIXED (Part 1.5):** `createScheduler` keeps `running` as state from a fixed anchor (the local midnight a day back), replayed once, advanced once per slot; tested (t vs t − SLOT, a contended parade case, anchors a day apart). **The scheduler re-decides the past as its window slides: events pop in mid-flight and vanish** (`harbor-events.js#schedule`,
   `n0 = n1 − ceil(longest / SLOT)`). A slot's admissions depend on lane conflicts with the slots before it; every 90 s the window
   drops its first slot, so the next slot is re-decided without the event that blocked it, and an event that was "blocked" a minute
   ago is "running at k ≈ 0.8" now. Measured with 5 sky events of 4 slots + 5 water events of 6 slots, all common, 9000 samples
   over 3000 slots: at 5217 of them an event was active that the schedule one slot earlier did not have. Rarer with few events, but
   it is exactly the long, contended case (a parade, the banner plane). The "deterministic" test compares a moment with itself and
   cannot see it. **Fix (before Part 6's first real event):** keep `running` as state advanced one slot at a time from a fixed anchor
   (replay from local midnight − 1 day at load, ≤ 1920 slots, once), advanced in the scene once per slot instead of recomputed from
   scratch every 500 ms; add a test that `schedule(t)` and `schedule(t − SLOT_MS)` agree on every event spanning both.
3. **FIXED (Part 1.5):** `plan()` keeps the baked canvases + `ready`; the stale layer draws (stretched after a resize / tier change) until the swap; rebakes wait for the crossfade; E2E: `setTier(1)` never blanks a stage pixel. **Every re-layout blanks the whole city until the next bake lands.** `bake.js#plan` sets `ready: false` on every group (the
   canvases keep their pixels, `scene.js#layer` skips them), and `layout() → plan()` runs on a tier step-down (exactly when frames
   are already slow — bake steps of 2–3 ms mean 10–20 frames of sky, boats and people over nothing), a desktop resize, `safeBottom`,
   and any measured dock / tag rect moving > 1 pt (`maybeRelayout`, e.g. the sign reflowing when the Google fonts swap in after
   the first bake). The crossfade exists but never gets a source on this path. Related: `baker.start()` queues a clear of `next` —
   the crossfade's source — so a second look change within 1.2 s of a bake landing (every `&speed=60` run) dims the city for the
   rest of the fade. **Fix:** in `plan()` keep `ready` and the old band's `y0 / h` for a group whose canvas size is unchanged and
   draw the stale `cur` until the swap (then the existing 1.2 s crossfade); on a resize / tier change draw the old `cur` stretched
   into the new band rather than nothing; gate `rebake()` on the crossfade being done. E2E: `setTier(1)` mid-session and assert a
   stage-band pixel is never the bare sky colour.
4. **→ Part 2.** **The gap-skip tears whole blocks out: the "corridors" are 13–94 pt holes, different in every band and at every size** (`band()`
   drops any block touching a gap and advances by the block's width). Measured clear width at the gaps (planned 6–10 pt): haze
   14–22, far 13–61, mid 22–92, near 46–72. Part 2's skyline inherits missing teeth where it wants narrow slots for the rays.
   **Fix:** clip, don't drop — end the block at the corridor's left edge and resume at its right (two blocks); pad the corridor by
   2 pt because a side face intrudes up to ~1.5 pt (z1 − z0 = 12–14).
5. **→ Part 2.** **Nothing can address a window.** `blocks.js#skyBlock` rolls the glitter from `rngFrom(round(x0·131 + z0·71 + h·31))` straight
   into the `far` / `near` bakes; no block carries rows, columns or a lit set, and the only windows with identity are the
   speakeasy's six. Part 2 (facades), Part 7 (rooms), Part 10 (flags in windows, a word lit across a facade), Part 11 (party
   windows, the small hours going dark) and the `windows` lane all need a per-building grid and a lit layer that is not in the
   look-key bake. (Also: `h` is in the seed, so the glitter re-rolls on every relayout.) **Fix now, in the layout:** give every
   block / landmark / hero `win: { cols, rows, u0, v0, pitch }` (world units, from the seed) and draw "which are lit" in its own
   cheap pass — a `lights` group re-baked on its own key (per minute) or sprites per frame — so a word, a wave or a flag is
   addressed by (building, col, row).
6. **FIXED (Part 1.5):** `laneRects` gives eight lanes real rects (sky-high / sky-low split), tested at six sizes against the sign, the corner buttons and the dock; `quiet` → `fs.density`, read by the planes, the birds, the swifts and the cars; drawn in `&grid=1`. **Lanes are names, not places; the sky has two schedulers; `quiet` reaches nobody.** The scene never reads `events.quiet`
   (it only returns it), and the district's aircraft / wildlife / fx modules keep their own clocks, so a Part 6 / 10 banner plane in
   the `sky` lane can meet a regular plane in the same strip and a heavy parade cannot thin the birds or the traffic. No lane has
   geometry: the grid draws `sky` as safeTop..limitY with the sign inside it (under the tagline there are exactly 10 pt), so a
   banner plane's only corridor is above the sign, and nothing states it. **Fix (before Part 6):** add lane rects to the layout
   (`sky-high`: safeTop..the neon's top, `sky-low`: the tagline's bottom..the roofline, water, road, promenade, the speakeasy's
   windows + rooftop) with tests like the door's (clear of the sign and the corner buttons, tall enough for a banner), and route
   `quiet` into `fs` as a density factor the aircraft / wildlife / traffic read.
7. **FIXED (Part 1.5):** `skyBlock` passes `y0` to `box()` (and lifts the crown, the hairline and the windows); no screen translate. **The landmark tiers are projected wrong** (`landmarks.js#landmarkSteps`): each tier is lifted with a screen translate of
   −F·y0 / z0, but its far edge is at z1, so a side face's top-far corner lands F·y0·(1/z0 − 1/z1) ≈ 8–9 pt too high on the
   sunburst's top tier; the setbacks' side faces lean. Invisible in grey, wrong under Part 5's shading and Part 4's reflections.
   **Fix:** pass `y0` to `box()` (it already supports it) and drop the translate.
8. **FIXED (Part 1.5):** `setUrlRoom` keeps `city=2` like `pdperf` (E2E: HOST → the URL keeps it → a refresh rejoins on it). **`setUrlRoom` strips `city=2` from the address bar the moment a room is entered** (`identity.js#setUrlRoom` keeps only
   `room / slot / emu / pdperf`). The page keeps the Harbor (the import was bound at load), but a refresh in the lobby, a rejoin,
   or the title after a refresh is today's city — a HOST → refresh test flow silently switches cities. "Never saved" holds; keep the
   flag in the URL the way `pdperf` is kept (one line) so a dev session stays on the Harbor across refreshes.
